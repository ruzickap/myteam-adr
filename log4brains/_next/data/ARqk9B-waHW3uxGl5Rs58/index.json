That way, you can become familiar with the whole project history\njust by reading its decision log in chronological order.\nMoreover, maintaining this documentation aims at:\n\n- üöÄ Improving and speeding up the onboarding of a new team member\n- üî≠ Avoiding blind acceptance/reversal of a past decision\n  (cf [Michael Nygard's famous article on ADRs](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html))\n- ü§ù Formalizing the decision process of the team\n\n## Usage\n\nThis site is automatically updated after a change on the `main` branch of the\nproject's Git repository.\nIn fact, the developers manage this documentation directly with Markdown files\nlocated next to their code, so it is more convenient for them to keep\nit up-to-date.\nYou can browse the ADRs by using the left menu or the search bar.\n\nThe typical workflow of an ADR is the following:\n\n![ADR workflow](/l4b-static/adr-workflow.png)\n\nThe decision process is entirely collaborative and backed by pull requests.\n\n## More information\n\n- [Log4brains documentation](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/tree/master#readme)\n- [What is an ADR and why should you use them](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/tree/master#-what-is-an-adr-and-why-should-you-use-them)\n- [ADR GitHub organization](https://adr.github.io/)\n","l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
