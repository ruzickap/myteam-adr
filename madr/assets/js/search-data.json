    "content": "An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. This might, for instance, be a technology choice (e.g., Java vs. JavaScript), a choice of the IDE (e.g., IntelliJ vs. Eclipse IDE), a choice between a library (e.g., SLF4J vs java.util.logging), or a decision on features (e.g., infinite undo vs. limited undo). Do not take the term “architecture” too seriously or interpret it too strongly. As the examples illustrate, any decisions that might have an impact on the architecture somehow are architectural decisions. It should be as easy as possible to a) write down the decisions and b) to version the decisions. There are debates what is an architecturally-significant decision and which decisions are not architecturally significant. Since we believe that any (important) decision should be captured in a structured way, we offer the MADR template to capture any decision. This repository offers a solution to record any decisions. It provides files to document any decisions using Markdown and Any Decision Records. Before MADR 3.0.0, “MADR” stood for Markdown and Architectural Decision Records. Since MADR 3.0.0, “Architectural” was replaced by “Any”. ",

Some proposals from the community are presented in the following. Usage of categories . MADR logs may be categorized ADRs by defining sub directories and put the ADRs into these folders. An examplary folder structure might follow the architectural structure of the system under construction: . `-- decisions |-- backend |-- 0001-use-quarkus.md `-- ui `-- 0001-use-vuejs.md . This approach makes all categories explicit because the sub directory/folder names define the categories. As a consequence, numbers of ADRs are no longer unique throughout the repository, but locally within a category only. Ideally, the ADR categorization the same organizing principles as other artifacts such as the code; using architectural structur breakdown is just one option and functional decomposition would be an additional one. This comes down to a meta-decision to be made rather early on. Note that alternatives to categorization via subfolders are discussed at ADR-0010. ",
